# Scenario

A California-based real estate agency has partnered with our software development company \
to create a machine learning-based that can predict the market value of residential properties. \
Currently, the agency relies on expert estimations to assess the properties value.\
These estimations have an average error rate of approximately 20%.\
To support our work, the real estate agency has provided a historical [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/california-housing-prices-data-extra-features) \
containing various property features.

# Problem Analysis

Manual expert-based valuation is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to inconsistency. \
With fluctuating market conditions and increasing data availability, there is a growing need\
for a scalable, consistent, and data-driven approach to property valuation \
that can outperform the current manual methods.
