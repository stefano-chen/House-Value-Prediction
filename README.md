# Scenario
A California-based real estate agency has partnered with our software development company \
to create a machine learning-based that can predict the market value of residential properties. \
Currently, the agency relies on expert estimations to assess the properties value.\
These estimations have an average error rate of approximately 20%.\
To support our work, the real estate agency has provided a historical dataset \
containing various property features along with estimated house values.

# Problem Analysis
Manual expert-based valuation is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to inconsistency. \
With fluctuating market conditions and increasing data availability, there is a growing need\
for a scalable, consistent, and data-driven approach to property valuation \
that can outperform the current manual methods.
